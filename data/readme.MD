## What's in this data folder

Data was provided by CCSU's [Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy](http://www.ccsu.edu/imrp/projects/taser.html), compiled from reports gathered by individual police departments as mandated by Connecticut law. However, this is a new form of data collection so quality of data varies department to department.

-----

* `2015 Reported Taser Data` - Hand-compiled raw data set based on forms filled out by officers after a stun gun was used in an incident (deployed meaning unholstered).
* `deployed.csv` - Stun deployment frequency by race.
* `weapons.csv` - What the suspect was wielding when confronted by police.
